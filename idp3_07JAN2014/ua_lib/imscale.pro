; IMSCALE -- Find the minimum and maximum values in an array;            after rejecting "bad" values using the standard;            deviation of the array.;; inputs are:;    im    an array of numbers;    ns    the number of standard deviations for rejection;; ouput    is an array of two values, the "good" minimum and "good" maximum.;; errors   an array containing [0.0,0.0] is returned if no data points in;          the array are within "ns" standard deviations of it's mean.function imscale, im, ns  x = size(im)  if x[0] lt 1 then return,[0.0,0.0]  m = moment(im,sdev=sdev)  g = where(abs(im-m(0)) lt (ns * sdev),n)  if n gt 0 then return,[min(im(g)),max(im(g))] else return,[0.0,0.0]end
